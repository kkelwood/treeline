# treeline

The goal of this research was to understand spatial patterns of tree establishment during the process of treeline advancement on Pikes Peak. This project was my first experience coding in R. It is fun for me to see how far I have come in my coding skills (e.g. writing functions, using tidyverse grammar principles, etc.)

Sample data files with 100 real data points are provided. Note that the actual data had 1163 data points.
